1. Step Obtaining Source
  as the first step you have to obtain the source code of U-Boot, with which you can build it.
  Download it or mirror the source code:
  Download: git clone https://source.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot.git
  Mirror Source: git clone https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot
2. Build it with GCC
  If you want to build it with Clang go to the U-Boot doc.
  First of you need dependencies, with which you can compile U-Boot.
  If you do it for the same architecture you are using the U-Boot later you use a GCC compiler and if it's a different architecture you will need a GCC cross compiler.
  
  We will do it with Debian:
  You could install GCC and the GCC cross compiler for the ARMv8 architecture with
>>    sudo apt-get install gcc gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
  Depending on the build targets further packages maybe needed
>>   sudo apt-get install bc bison build-essential coccinelle \
      device-tree-compiler dfu-util efitools flex gdisk graphviz imagemagick \
      liblz4-tool libgnutls28-dev libguestfs-tools libncurses-dev \
      libpython3-dev libsdl2-dev libssl-dev lz4 lzma lzma-alone openssl \
      pkg-config python3 python3-asteval python3-coverage python3-filelock \
      python3-pkg-resources python3-pycryptodome python3-pyelftools \
      python3-pytest python3-pytest-xdist python3-sphinxcontrib.apidoc \
      python3-sphinx-rtd-theme python3-subunit python3-testtools \
      python3-virtualenv swig uuid-dev
  
  Prerequisites:
    In our case we need prerequisite files, because we do have a TV-Box, which is kinda specific to the Allwinner Board in this case.
  Building Arm Trusted Firmware (TF-A):
    The "secure world" on arm64 machines is a special level of CPU privilege that is hidden from the normal OS, and has complete control over the system. 
    It provides both initialization during early boot stages (before u-boot or EFI) and system monitor functionality once the machine is booted up. 
    This is an equivalent of Intel ME on x86. (from https://packages.debian.org/buster/arm-trusted-firmware)
  
    We do have to do the following for the H618:
      git clone https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware.git
      cd arm-trusted-firmware
      make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- PLAT=sun50i_h616 DEBUG=1
      
  Building the U-Boot image
    Get information from the currently running system on it. If you are willing to you can connect your device to your wifi and install mixplorer for example. But i recommend to not connect it with your wifi
    and just get the apk of mixplorer and copy the whole Root folder from your device to an usb-stick.
    Now you will take the vontar defconfig and dts and drop it into the the corresponding folders.

    apt-get install libssl-dev
    apt-get install swig
    sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-de
